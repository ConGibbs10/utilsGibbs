# utilsGibbs
Connor Gibbs' utility functions, some written personally and others compiled from the web, largely [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). To install this package, use `devtools::install_github('ConGibbs10/utilsGibbs')`.

In an effort of transparency, here are some sources I've pulled from:
- `log10_minor_breaks()` from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30179442/plotting-minor-breaks-on-a-log-scale-with-ggplot)
- `zero_range()` from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752275/test-for-equality-among-all-elements-of-a-single-numeric-vector)

I may have edited their code as I saw fit. My apolgizes if I am missing any credit where credit is due.
